In the city of *Raesfeld, there is a special place.
A place where everyone gets free *bratwurst and *gebaeck.
It is on the *Hauptstrasse.
There, a *Wettbewerbsfahig *Hund bakes *Apfelkuchen.
I hope I drive a *BMW or *Porsche in *Berlin one day.
-Thought the *Hund, while in his *Baeckerei.
it's a nice weather to wear *Lederhosen
I would drive it to go pick up an *apfelkuchen from the *baeckerei.
In the *Biergarten, he met a *Dirndl-wearing baker named *Mehlhase.
Together they visited *Schloss *Eltz to escape the summer heat and admire the *Klimaanlage.
While chatting, Mehlhase began to tell of her porsche in Berlin.
As the sun set over *Raesfeld, they shared stories under the fairy lights of the *Ratskeller, paws dusted with flour.
With dusk settled, Arfy the *Hund drifted off and dreamt of *apfelkuchen and other *gebaeck.
