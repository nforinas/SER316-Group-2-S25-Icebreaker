In the city of *Raesfeld, there is a special place.
A place where everyone gets free *bratwurst and *gebaeck.
It is on the *Hauptstrasse. 
There, a *Wettbewerbsfahig *Hund bakes *Apfelkuchen.
I hope I drive a *BMW or *Porsche in *Berlin one day.
-Thought the *Hund, while in his *Baeckerei.
I would drive it to go pick up an *apfelkuchen from the *baeckerei.
