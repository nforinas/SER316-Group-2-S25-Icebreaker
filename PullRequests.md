//Thank you for visiting Group 2's' repo.

===============================================================================
//Visitors from other teams should make their change to story.txt and
//create their pull request for Group 2 on our repo.
//Note when adding a line to story.txt, use a German word from dictionary.txt

//Note that the assignment says team members should log the link to any pull 
//requests they create in other teams' repos, in PullRequests.md in their 
//repo.

//This implies your team should have a copy of PullRequests.md in your 
//icebreaker git repo for logging the pull request you've made here.

//However the phrasing in the assignment document is kind of vague. So
//we have created an additional area for visitors to this repo to log
//their pull request.

//Group 2 members can log their pull requests to other teams after this line.
//Use the sha256 hash or other unique link for your pull request:
